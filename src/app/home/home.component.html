      <h4 class = "custom-font2">Welcome to a website all about showcasing and reviewing some of the popular warcraft 3 custom games made by the community.
        Warcraft 3 was made in 2003 by Blizzard Entertainment and launched with a easy to use game engine using Blizzard's Art assets and featuring their own GUI
        and scripting language JASS. This was enough to create a community of content creators who have impacted the gaming environment with their ideas and also
        popularizing the MOBA genre with successors like DOTA 2, League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm and more. If you have any custom games you'd like to see 
        reviewed on here, send me an email.</h4>
